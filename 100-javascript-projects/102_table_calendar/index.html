            <td>
              Our Robotics CCA team will be exploring the basics of Micro:bit radio communication, focusing on how to create simple transmitter and receiver systems using code.
              All taught by our professional coach ...

              During this session, members will:
              
              Learn how to use Micro:bit's radio feature to send and receive signals wirelessly.
              
              Program one Micro:bit as a transmitter and another as a receiver.
              
              Implement actions such as:
              
              Pressing Button A to transmit one icon (e.g., a smiley face).
              
              Pressing Button B to transmit a different icon (e.g., a heart).
              
              Tilting the Micro:bit to trigger and send a third icon.
