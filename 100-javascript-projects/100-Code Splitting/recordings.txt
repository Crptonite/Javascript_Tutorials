âœ… 2. Bug in firstDay Calculation
js
Copy
Edit
const firstDay = new Date(currentYear, currentMonth, 0);
This gets the last day of the previous month, not the first day of the current month.

It should be:

js
Copy
Edit
const firstDay = new Date(currentYear, currentMonth, 1);
Otherwise, firstDayIndex may be off.
