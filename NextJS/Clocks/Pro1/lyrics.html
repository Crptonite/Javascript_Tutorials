        We're talking away
        I don't know what I'm to say
        I'll say it anyway
        Today is another day to find you
        Shyin' away
        Oh, I'll be comin' for your love, okay
        Take on me
        (Take on me)
        Take me on
        (Take on me)
        I'll be gone
        In a day or two
        So needless to say
        I'm odds and ends
        But I'll be stumblin' away
        Slowly learnin' that life is okay
        Say after me
        It's no better to be safe than sorry
        Take on me
        (Take on me)
        Take me on
        (Take on me)
        I'll be gone
        In a day or two
        All the things that you say, yeah
        Is it life or just to play my worries away?
        You're all the things I've got to remember
        You're shyin' away
        I'll be comin' for you anyway
        Take on me
        (Take on me)
        Take me on
        (Take on me)
        I'll be gone
        In a day
        (Take on me)
        (Take on me)
        (Take me on)
        (Take on me)
        I'll be gone
        (Take on me)
        In a day
        (Take me on)
        (Take on me)
        (Take on me)
        (Take on me)
        (Take me on)
        (Take on me)
    </p>
