# Memory Game Project

## Description
The Memory Game is a classic card-matching game that helps improve memory and concentration skills. The objective of the game is to match pairs of cards with the same image. The game begins with all cards faced down, and players take turns flipping over two cards at a time, trying to find matching pairs.

## Features

### Feature 1: Interactive Gameplay
- Players can flip cards to reveal images.
- Cards will flip back if they do not match, allowing players to try again.
- A matching pair will stay face-up, contributing to the player's score.

### Feature 2: Timer and Moves Counter
- A timer to keep track of how long it takes to complete the game.
- A moves counter to record the number of attempts made to find all pairs.
- Both timer and moves counter reset with each new game.

### Feature 3: Responsive Design
- The game layout adjusts to different screen sizes for optimal play on desktop and mobile devices.
- Cards and UI elements resize accordingly to maintain a pleasant user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: Implements game logic and interactivity.
