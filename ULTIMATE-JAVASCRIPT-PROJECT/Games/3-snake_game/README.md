# Snake Game

## Description

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player maneuvers a snake to collect food items. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer, making the game progressively more challenging. The game ends when the snake runs into itself or the walls.

## Features

- **Simple Controls**: Navigate the snake using arrow keys.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of the player's score as the snake consumes food.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: The snake grows longer and moves faster with each food item consumed.

## Technologies Used
