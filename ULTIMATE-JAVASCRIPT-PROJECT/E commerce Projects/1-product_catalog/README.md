## Description

The Product Catalog project is a web application designed to showcase and manage a collection of products. It provides users with an interface to browse, search, and view detailed information about each product, enhancing their shopping or informational experience.

## Features

- **Product Listing**: Display a grid or list of products with basic information such as name, price, and image.
- **Product Details**: Clicking on a product shows comprehensive details including description, specifications, and reviews.
- **Search and Filter**: Enable users to search for products by name, category, or other attributes. Allow filtering by price range or availability.
