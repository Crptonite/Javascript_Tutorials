Sure, let's update the technologies used section to better reflect the JWT authentication project setup:

# JWT Authentication

## Description

JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication is a robust authentication method used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This project demonstrates a simple implementation of JWT-based authentication in a web application. It ensures secure user authentication and authorization, allowing only authenticated users to access protected routes and resources.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Allows new users to register by providing a username and password. The password is hashed for security.
- **User Login**: Authenticates users with their username and password. Upon successful authentication, a JWT is generated and returned.
- **Protected Routes**: Ensures that certain routes are accessible only to authenticated users by verifying the JWT.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment used to build the backend.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js used to build the API.
- **bcryptjs**: Library to hash passwords for secure storage.
- **jsonwebtoken**: Library to create and verify JWTs.
- **dotenv**: Module to load environment variables from a `.env` file.

## Setup

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/deepakkumar55/ULTIMATE-JAVASCRIPT-PROJECT.git
    cd Security\ Projects/1-jwt_authentication
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then run:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
    ```
    PORT=3000
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    ```

4. **Run the Server**:
    Start the server using:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

5. **Access the Application**:
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.


### Final Steps
1. **Run the Server**: Use the following command to start the server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
2. **Test the Endpoints**:
    - **Register a User**: Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/auth/register` with a JSON body containing `username` and `password`.
    - **Login a User**: Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/auth/login` with a JSON body containing `username` and `password`. You'll receive a JWT token if the credentials are valid.
    - **Access Protected Route**: Send a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/auth/protected` with an `Authorization` header containing `Bearer <your_jwt_token>`.
