## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

Follow these steps to set up and contribute to a GitHub repository:

### 1. Fork the Repository

- Go to the GitHub repository you want to contribute to and click on the **Fork** button at the top right corner.
- This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

### 2. Clone the Repository

- Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
   ```
- Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and `repo-name` with the name of the repository.

### 3. Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd repo-name
```

### 4. Create a New Branch

- Create a new branch to make your changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

- Use a meaningful name for your branch, e.g., `fix-issue-10` or `add-new-feature`.

### 5. Make Your Changes

- Edit the files as needed. For example, add a new feature or fix a bug.
- If the project uses HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, make sure to test your changes locally.

### 6. Stage and Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add a meaningful commit message"
```

### 7. Push Changes to GitHub

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### 8. Create a Pull Request

- Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
- Click on the **Compare & pull request** button.
- Provide a title and description for your pull request, then click **Create pull request**.

### 9. Review and Merge

- Your pull request will be reviewed by the repository maintainers.
- If everything looks good, your changes will be merged. If there are issues, the maintainers might ask for revisions.

## ü§ù Contribution Guidelines

- Make sure to follow the code style and guidelines specified in the repository.
- Keep your commits small and focused on a single issue or feature.
- Provide clear and descriptive commit messages.
